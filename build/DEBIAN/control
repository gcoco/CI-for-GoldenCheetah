Description: set of analysis tools for cycling performance
 GoldenCheetah is a software package that:
  * Downloads ride data directly from the CycleOps PowerTap and
   the SRM PowerControl V. Support for SRM PowerControl VI and VII
   is planned for the future.
  * Imports ride data downloaded with other programs, including
   TrainingPeaks WKO+ and the manufacturers' software for the Ergomo,
   Garmin, Polar, PowerTap, and SRM devices.
  * Provides a rich set of analysis tools, including a critical power graph,
   BikeScore calculation, histogram analysis, a best interval finder, and
   a pedal force versus pedal velocity chart, to name just a few.
